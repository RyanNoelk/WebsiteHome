Hi, I'm Ryan. I like playing around with new and, in my opinion, cool tech. This website is a showcase of some of the stuff that I've built over the years. It's also a place for me to play around with random stuff.

I've been working in the tech industry for several years now. My focus is on UI and web development, as well as optimizing sites for high availability with millions of users. Be sure to check out my projects.

I used some of http://startbootstrap.com's styles to help me build this page.
